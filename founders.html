                            Randy is a systems builder with 15+ years in AI and engineering. His background spans a Ph.D. at Michigan State University focused on creating AI and years architecting data-driven solutions for organizations ranging from startups to large enterprises. At Wyrd Studios, he owns the AI stack and product strategy. He turns messy, human workflows into reliable automation that gives people more control over their digital lives.

                            Olivia is an experience architect who designs clarity from chaos. She has degrees in Cognitive Science and Design Engineering, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI. Her career has spanned startups, large tech companies, and government.

                            Her approach puts the human at the center of every system. She finds where people get lost, designs for intuition, and ships experiences that build trust. Whether modernizing large-scale enterprise systems or refining the smallest interactions, her focus is always on prioritizing clarity over clutter. The goal is to create inclusive, calm technology that reduces friction, sparks curiosity, and empowers users to navigate complexity with confidence.
